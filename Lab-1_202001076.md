## Q1.Identify FRs and NFRs:
### FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
    1.Borrowing the book and returning the book.
    2.Administrative privileges to the librarian for entering a new record when a new book is purchased or remove a record when a book is taken off-shelf.
    3.Enabling a member to extend the date of his borrowing if no other booking for that particular book has been made.
    4.A Verification email is sent to the user whenever he/she registers for the first time.
    5.Authentication of user whenever he/she logs into the system.
    6.System should be able to handle concurrent bookings
    7.Security risk of the software should be taken care. 
    8.Issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.
    9.The web application should run only within the institute LAN.
    10.Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books online.

### NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIRMENTS:
    1. No confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in plain text.
    2.The processing of each request should be done within 10 seconds.
    3.A website should be capable enough to handle 20 million users with affecting its performance.
    4.The software should be portable. So moving from one OS to another OS does not create any problem.
    5. The website should be able to handle a large number of users without affecting the performance of the website.
    6.The website should reload it information every 5 min.
    7.The web application must be build using the recent HTML5
 
 
## Q2.Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
### SCOPE:
    We are creating an android application for people who suffer from disabling hearing loss using an Artificial Intelligence software which recognises basic key sounds such as vehicle sounds and someone crying for help(ex.babies) and gives immediate alerts via vibration to the users 
  and it must have low latency so that it can be used anywhere and the predictions of the AI must be Accurate.
  
### FEATURES:
    1.It uses Artificial Intelligence to recognise basic key sounds events of interest to the community such as car sounds and babies.
    2.The software gives immediate alerts through vibration to the user when it detects the sounds.
    3.It is a mobile application and portable i.e it can be used in any type of OS software.
    4.Continuous logging is done for sending immediate alerts
    5.The app uses less power and have low latency for extended use.
    6.Notify friends and family in case when no response from the user when a critical situation is detected
  
### NON-FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS:
    1.This app is optimized for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.
    2.The software must be logging continuously so that an immediate alert can be sent.
    3.The app should be portable. So moving from one OS to another OS does not create any problem.
    4.The app should be able to track the live location of users that can be sent to friends and family in emergency situations.
